# GiphyAPI

## Technologies used:
Visual Studio Code, jQuery, Giphy API

## Summary: This assignment was designed to focus in on the ins-and-outs of API call and what they do. Through this assignment I learned how to properly set up a GET request to Giphy's API to return a limit of 10 gifs once a user clicks on the name of a specific button. This button was created througj jQuery techniques to create new HTML elements and provide them with certain attributes. I learned a ton in this assignment, although I felt confused many times. Everything works minus clicking on a gif to make it pause or animate, even though the data-state switches in the console. Enjoy searching through some Disney related apps! If you have the time, please provide comments on this assignment on where it is I missed in making the gifs either animate or stop.

## Steps:
1. I first did research by re-watching class videos from last week to get an understanding of the building blocks at play in order to create "the big picture".
2. I created an application on Giphy and received their public API key
3. I went through code drills for reference on code used to make the application work.
4. I talked with my tutor and got an understanding of how to test pieces of an app bit-by-bit (i.e. making frequent console.logs in order to see at which point is code breaking).
5. I set up the Ajax request and button appending thanks to code drills.
6. I dug through JSON data to see the array in detail and pinpoint the exact URL I needed to find.
7. Combined working pieces together and built the app!
